The official release date of all Project Gutenberg Etexts is at
Midnight, Central Time, of the last day of the stated month.  A
preliminary version may often be posted for suggestion, comment
and editing by those who wish to do so.  To be sure you have an
up to date first edition [xxxxx10x.xxx] please check file sizes
in the first week of the next month.  Since our ftp program has
a bug in it that scrambles the date [tried to fix and failed] a
look at the file size will have to do, but we will try to see a
new copy has at least one byte more or less.


Information about Project Gutenberg (one page)

We produce about two million dollars for each hour we work.  The
fifty hours is one conservative estimate for how long it we take
to get any etext selected, entered, proofread, edited, copyright
searched and analyzed, the copyright letters written, etc.  This
projected audience is one hundred million readers.  If our value
per text is nominally estimated at one dollar, then we produce 2
million dollars per hour this year we, will have to do four text
files per month:  thus upping our productivity from one million.
The Goal of Project Gutenberg is to Give Away One Trillion Etext
Files by the December 31, 2001.  [10,000 x 100,000,000=Trillion]
This is ten thousand titles each to one hundred million readers,
which is 10% of the expected number of computer users by the end
of the year 2001.

We need your donations more than ever!

<Xpage=1>

<hw>A</hw> <tt>(<it>named  'be in the English, and most commonly  '84 in other languages</it>)</tt>. <def> The first letter of the English and of many other alphabets. The capital A of the alphabets of Middle and Western Europe, as also the small letter (a), besides the forms in Italic, black letter, etc., are all descended from the old Latin A, which was borrowed from the Greek <spn>Alpha</spn>, of the same form; and this was made from the first letter (<i>Aleph</i>, and itself from the Egyptian origin. The <i>Aleph</i> was a consonant letter, with a guttural breath sound that was not an element of Greek articulation; and the Greeks took it to represent their vowel <i>Alpha</i> with the  '84 sound, the Ph 'd2nician alphabet having no vowel symbols.</def>

This letter, in English, is used for several different vowel sounds. See <i>Guide to pronunciation</i>, §§ 43-74. The regular long <i>a</i>, as in <i>fate</i>, etc., is a comparatively modern sound, and has taken the place of what, till about the early part of the 17th century, was a sound of the quality of  '84 (as in <i>far</i>).

<p><b>2.</b> <fld>(Mus.)</fld> <def>The name of the sixth tone in the model major scale (that in C), or the first tone of the minor scale, which is named after it the scale in A minor. The second string of the violin is tuned to the A in the treble staff. -- A sharp (A#) is the name of a musical tone intermediate between A and B. -- A flat (A&flat;) is the name of a tone intermediate between A and G.</def>

<hw>A-.</hw> <def>A, as a prefix to English words, is derived from various sources.

(4) Old English <i>y-</i> or <i>i-</i> (corrupted from the AS. inseparable particle <i>ge-</i>, cognate with OHG. <i>ga-</i>, <i>gi-</i>, Goth. <i>ga-</i>), which, as a prefix, made no essential addition to the meaning, as in aware.

<syn>Syn. -- To give up; yield; forego; cede; surrender; resign; abdicate; quit; relinquish; renounce; desert; forsake; leave; retire; withdraw from.</syn> -- <usage><er>To Abandon</er>, <er>Desert</er>, <er>Forsake</er>. These words agree in representing a person as <i>giving up</i> or <i>leaving</i> some object, but differ as to the mode of doing it. The distinctive sense of abandon is that of giving up a thing absolutely and finally; as, to abandon one's friends, places, opinions, good or evil habits, a hopeless enterprise, a shipwrecked vessel. <i>Abandon</i> is more widely applicable than <i>forsake</i> or <i>desert</i>. The Latin original of <i>desert</i> appears to have been originally applied to the case of deserters from military service. Hence, the verb, when used of <i>persons</i> in the active voice, has usually or always a bad sense, implying some breach of fidelity, honor, etc., the leaving of something which the person should rightfully stand by and support; as, to <i>desert</i> one's colors, to <i>desert</i> one's post, to <i>desert</i> one's principles or duty. When used in the passive, the sense is not necessarily bad; as, the fields were <i>deserted</i>, a <i>deserted</i> village, <i>deserted</i> halls. <i>Forsake</i> implies the breaking off of previous habit, association, personal connection, or that the thing left had been familiar or frequented; as, to forsake old friends, to <i>forsake</i> the paths of rectitude, the blood forsook his cheeks. It may be used either in a good or in a bad sense.</usage>

<syn>Syn. -- To <er>Abase</er>, <er>Debase</er>, <er>Degrade</er>. These words agree in the idea of bringing down from a higher to a lower state. <i>Abase</i> has reference to a bringing down in condition or feelings; as to <i>abase</i> one's self before God. <i>Debase</i> has reference to the bringing down of a thing in purity, or <i>making it base</i>. It is, therefore, always used in a bad sense, as, to <i>debase</i> the coin of the kingdom, to <i>debase</i> the mind by vicious indulgence, to <i>debase</i> one's style by coarse or vulgar expressions. <i>Degrade</i> has reference to a bringing down from some higher <i>grade</i> or from some standard. Thus, a priest is <i>degraded</i> from the clerical office. When used in a moral sense, it denotes a bringing down in character and just estimation; as, <i>degraded</i> by intemperance, a <i>degrading</i> employment, etc. "Art is <i>degraded</i> when it is regarded only as a trade."</syn>

<i>Milton.</i></blockquote>

<blockquote>He was a man whom no check could <b>abash</b>.
<i>Macaulay.</i></blockquote>

<syn>Syn. -- To confuse; confound; disconcert; shame.</syn> <usage> -- To <er>Abash</er>, Confuse, <er>Confound</er>. <i>Abash</i> is a stronger word than <i>confuse</i>, but not so strong as <i>confound</i>. We are <i>abashed</i> when struck either with sudden shame or with a humbling sense of inferiority; as, Peter was <i>abashed</i> in the presence of those who are greatly his superiors. We are confused when, from some unexpected or startling occurrence, we lose clearness of thought and self-possession. Thus, a witness is often confused by a severe cross-examination; a timid person is apt to be confused in entering a room full of strangers. We are <i>confounded</i> when our minds are overwhelmed, as it were, by something wholly unexpected, amazing, dreadful, etc., so that we have nothing to say. Thus, a criminal is usually <i>confounded</i> at the discovery of his guilt.</usage>

<syn>Syn. -- To subside; decrease; intermit; decline; diminish; lessen.</syn> <usage> -- To <er>Abate</er>, <er>Subside</er>. These words, as here compared, imply a coming down from some previously raised or exited state. <i>Abate</i> expresses this in respect to degrees, and implies a diminution of force or of intensity; as, the storm <i>abates</i>, the cold <i>abates</i>, the force of the wind <i>abates</i>; or, the wind <i>abates</i>, a fever <i>abates</i>. Subside (to settle down) has reference to a previous state of agitation or commotion; as, the waves <i>subside</i> after a storm, the wind subsides into a calm. When the words are used figuratively, the same distinction should be observed. If we conceive of a thing as having different degrees of intensity or strength, the word to be used is abate. Thus we say, a man's anger <i>abates</i>, the ardor of one's love abates, "Winter rage <i>abates</i>". But if the image be that of a sinking down into quiet from preceding excitement or commotion, the word to be used is <i>subside</i>; as, the tumult of the people <i>subsides</i>, the public mind <i>subsided</i> into a calm. The same is the case with those emotions which are tumultuous in their nature; as, his passion <i>subsides</i>, his joy quickly <i>subsided</i>, his grief <i>subsided</i> into a pleasing melancholy. Yet if, in such cases, we were thinking of the degree of violence of the emotion, we might use <i>abate</i>; as, his joy will <i>abate</i> in the progress of time; and so in other instances.</usage>
